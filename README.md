# AidTrace

AidTrace is a web application that empowers users to make automatic, traceable charity donations when a major earthquake occurs in the U.S. The user may make a donation to a selected charity at any time. As soon as an earthquake of at least 7.0 magnitude is reported by the U.S. Geological Survey, the user's donation will be immediately disbursed to the charity. The transaction history of the donation's deposit and withdrawal is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain for future reference by all stakeholders.

AidTrace is currently a prototype under development.
